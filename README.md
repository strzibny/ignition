# Ignition

Ignition is an Elixir/Phoenix application to kickstart new projects. It's conveniently called `MyApp` so you can build fast by copying & pasting from documentation and turorials.

## Features

Ignition is a Phoenix 1.6 application with LiveView and esbuild.

Here's what's built on top:

- [Pow](https://github.com/danschultzer/pow) authentication with email confirmations and password resets. The authentication is easily extentable with other Pow plugins and [Pow Assent](https://github.com/pow-auth/pow_assent) can be added for social logins.

The list will be hopefully longer :).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute a feature, open an issue. Please don't open issues with feature requests that you won't work on.

## Support

The code is free and unlicenced. Make something cool.
